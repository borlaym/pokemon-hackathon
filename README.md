React-Redux starter project

## Running your project

The generated project includes a development server on port `3000`, which will rebuild the app whenever you change application code. To start the server (with the dev-tools enabled), run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

To run the server with the dev-tools disabled, run:

```bash
$ DEBUG=false npm start
```

The built in dev-tools are able to save state between reloads. Just pass the `debug_session=true` parameter to the url.


To build for production, this command will output optimized production code:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

To run all tests once, run:
```bash
$ npm test
```

To keep a test server running, run:
```bash
$ karma start
```
